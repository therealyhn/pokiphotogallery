# Poki Photo Gallery  

Single-page wedding photo gallery built with **React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS**.  
Created as a **wedding gift** for my **godfather and godmother (Orthodox tradition)**.  

The page features a vertical **timeline layout** where photos appear in chronological order, alternating left and right. Each photo is accompanied by a **year** and a **short description**. The design is elegant, minimal, and fully responsive.
