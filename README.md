# 💍 Olja & Andrija Memories

A personal, chronologically organized **digital love album** built with **React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS** — celebrating the story of **Olja & Andrija** from the first days of their relationship to the wedding itself.

This web app serves both as a **timeline of their journey** and as an **interactive live wedding gallery**, allowing selected guests (godparents, best friends, and close family) to upload their own photos in real time during the wedding — all securely protected by a password.

- On mobile, the layout adapts to a centered, clean vertical flow.

### 📸 Guest Upload System (Password Protected)

- During the wedding, invited guests can **upload their own photos** directly from the site.
- Each upload requires a **shared password**, ensuring that only authorized users (e.g. family, close friends, godparents) can contribute.
