Poki Photo Gallery

Single-page wedding photo gallery built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
Created as a wedding gift for my godfather and godmother (Orthodox tradition).

The page features a vertical timeline layout where photos appear in chronological order, alternating left and right. Each photo is accompanied by a year and a short description. The design is elegant, minimal, and fully responsive.
